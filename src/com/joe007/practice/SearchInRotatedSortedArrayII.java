/**
 * 
 * Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

 * Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
 * What if duplicates are allowed?
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 * Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
